# NFT art generator (generative art) ðŸŽ¨

Important: This project was forked from user: HashLips.

# How to use
## Run the code
1. Run `node index.js`
2. Open the `./output` folder to find your generated images to use as NFTs, as well as the metadata to use for NFT marketplaces.

## Adjust the provided configuration and resources
You will see some default attributes i've included for the use of my personal project. Feel free to run the index.js with some custom attributes and see the new output that is generated every time.
